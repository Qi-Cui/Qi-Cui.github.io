I am a currently Master's student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign</a>. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, and Mathematics from the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. Prior to that, I spent a year studying Mathematics and Economics at the <a href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>.

I am currently serving as a summer intern with the <a href="https://www.tencent.com/">Tencent</a> Paas Platform Infrastructure Development Team. Previously, I developed robotics software for stroke rehabilitation at the <a href="https://neurro-lab.engin.umich.edu/">NeuRRo Lab</a>, under the supervision of Dr. Chandramouli Krishnan. Prior to that, I worked at the <a href="https://www.assetlab.org/">Asset Lab</a>, where I developed predictive models for electricity demand, advised by Dr. Michael Craig.
