I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign</a>. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, and Mathematics from the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. Prior to that, I spent a year studying Mathematics and Economics at the <a href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>.

I spent the summer of 2024 serving as a backend developer intern with the <a href="https://www.tencent.com/">Tencent</a> Paas Platform Infrastructure Development Team. Previously, I developed a robotics software for stroke rehabilitation at the <a href="https://neurro-lab.engin.umich.edu/">NeuRRo Lab</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://neurro-lab.engin.umich.edu/people/chandramouli-krishnan">Dr. Chandramouli Krishnan</a>. Prior to that, I worked at the <a href="https://www.assetlab.org/">Asset Lab</a>, where I developed predictive models for electricity demand, advised by <a href="https://seas.umich.edu/research/faculty/michael-craig">Dr. Michael Craig</a>.
